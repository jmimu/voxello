TODO:
* collision tests: one transform for each object, voxel perfect ?
* load other formats
* animation: pre-computed neigh if objet is not modifiable

Optimization:
* compute where is each rendered voxel in camera's frame;
    depending on the quarter and the objet orientation,
    render only 3 faces.
